                                        I've proudly been with ParNav Foundation from its inception,
                                        witnessing impactful initiatives during crises like COVID
                                        and floods. We extend helping hands in times of calamities,
                                        ensuring education for underprivileged children and providing
                                        essentials for the present. Our flagship program involves
                                        saving lives through blood donation promotion and camps.
                                        The driving force is selfless service, inspired by our
                                        founder Atul Kumar Singh, who constantly motivates us
                                        to strive for better every day.

                                        Parnav Foundation is a innocent approach to
                                        help the society we live in . In this
                                        foundation we work for unfortunate people who
                                        are born into poverty and helplessness. Our aim
                                        is to provide a small ray of sunlight on cold
                                        days to those who need it. Few of our initiatives
                                        includes Blood Donation , Educating Children,
                                        Blanket Donation and more.
